            <p>A German craftsman named Johannes Gutenberg developed a way to automate book 
                copying via a press. This process utilizes an inked top and a lower platen below which in turn. 
                This helped produce books quickly and accurately that could produce 250 pages.

                Dates back in 1754, a cartoon by Benjamin Franklin is one of the first well known illustration in a 
                newspaper cartoon. Entitled as "Join or die", it depicts a snake divided in eight pieces which 
                represents the eight colonies. This often appears in every conflict through the revolutionary 
                war at that time.

            <p>
                Ever since the invention of the pen, these art styles were characterized with hatching and cross hatching.
                One of the famous examples is Thomas Nast, with his style of persuasive cartoons, he managed to affect
                the outcome of six different elections based off his activism. He is attributed to invent a stereotypical
                 businessman in character in suit that is obese and is driven by greed.

            <span><strong>These illustrations have known to be a dangerous game</strong></span>
            <p>Throughout history, these illustrators risk reprisal as they often poke fun or critique the status quo. 
                This is what happened with the 19th century french lithographer Honore Daumer which he portrays the king 
                as a grotesque giant that is exploiting the hard work of his people. The king fined and imprisoned 
                the artist then banned his cartoons.

            <p>The Philippine free press (PFP), which dates back during the martial law, were few of the

            <p>The rise of political turmoil during the COVID 19 pandemic and the succeeding 
                administration help gave rise to the popularity of the art style online. 
                This made artists adapt to the modern times and use a digital art style,
                even going so far to adapt memes and other popular culture into their work.
                This help develop solidarity among fellow artists and their followers at
                online spaces.
